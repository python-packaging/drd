And by all we also mean\nlibc, glib, libssl and any other library. This may render having\noutdated bundles a security issue. But bundles can be easily \nrebuilt by user or developers so it just takes an update.\n\nA draw-back of this feature is that the resulting AppImage have a\nlarger size, yet it's about ~10 mb which _is not a big deal in\nmodern times_.\n\n\n## distributions compatibility testing\n\nCompatibility tests can be easily setup to run the resulting\nbundle in different distributions by means of docker. Therefore\ndevelopers can have a real idea of where they software will be\nable to run.\n\n\n## Embed software tracking\n\nAs the bundle is built using the packages from the host system \npackage manager it's possible to store the exact list of which\nsoftware was embed and it's version. By retriving this information\nsecurity tools can detect if there are vulnerabilities reported\nfor such versions and warn the users about it.\n\n## AppDir structure validation\n\nTo check whether the AppDir is properly formed and there are no\nmissing resources.\n\n## Reproducible builds\n\nRecipes can be embed in the resulting bundle so users can recreate\nthe package without major efforts and compare the results.\n\n## Assisted licensing compliance\n\nThe host system package manager already include the licenses of\nevery software piece therefore this information is also passed\ninto the resulting bundle.\n\n## continuous integration ready\n\nProvide hooks to publish the resulting bundle into the different\napplications stores or binary hosting services.\n\n",
